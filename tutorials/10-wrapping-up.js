You made it! Great work 👏👏👏👏👏

By this point you should now have a pretty solid understanding of how to use GraphQL as a client application developer. I hope you've been able to see the possibilities that GraphQL gives us as app developers and that you're maybe even excited to go further!

### Where Do I Go From Here?

Even though we touched on a lot of GraphQL topics in this interactive tutorial, there's a lot that we didn't go over. One of the biggest areas of GraphQL that we didn't really see anything on is about the backend. You may have noticed that we've been connected to a GraphQL server this whole time. Perhaps you're now wondering how you can make your own.

### Free Video Course Incoming!

If you enjoyed this tutorial and you'd like to go even further with GraphQL, I invite you to sign up to be notified about my upcoming free video tutorial series which will cover everything you need to know to create your first fully-featured GraphQL application. The course is scheduled to be released in Spring of 2019 and I'll keep you up-to-date on the details!
