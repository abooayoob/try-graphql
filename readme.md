# Try GraphQL!

This is a React app built with Next.js that powers [Try GraphQL](https://trygql.com).

## Installation

Clone the repo and run:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

This is my first real React app so there's probably a bunch of stuff I'm doing wrong. I bet you'll find an anti-pattern or two in these here codes. Pull requests and general guidance are welcome!

## TODO

- [] Clean up the three challenge status components so there's not so much code repition
- [] Find a better way to organize and import all the markdown files
- [] Write tests
- [] Add descriptions of each tutorial for `meta` tags
