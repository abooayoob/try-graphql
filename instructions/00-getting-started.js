## Say Hello!

To the right is a very special in-browser editor called **GraphiQL**. Its job is to give us a place to write queries and play around with a GraphQL backend.

Want to run a quick query to get a preview of some data? Just put the query in the left side and the result will come through on the right side.

Want to view which kinds of queries you can make to the particular GraphQL server we're connected to? Click the "Docs" tab and you'll be able to view them all.

### Challenge

The left side of the GraphiQL editor is pre-loaded with a simple query. Hit the play button up at the top to run the query and see what gets returned.
