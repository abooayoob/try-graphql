## Write a Simple GraphQL Query

To write a query with GraphQL, we first state what we want to do. Since we want to compose a query, we can use the \`query\` keyword and follow it up with some braces.

\`\`\`js
query {}
\`\`\`

This is only part of it though. A query is no good if we don't tell GraphQL exactly what we want.

### Challenge

Compose a query in the editor to the right. In the query, ask for a field called \`secretMessage\`.

When you've finished writing the query, hit the play button at the top of the editor to run it.
