## Make a GraphQL Request with React

Making GraphQL requests from a React app is relatively straightforward thanks to the tools that come from Apollo. We can use Apollo's \`Query\` component to create a React component which queries for some data and displays the result.

### Challenge

Fill out the query to return the contacts list, including \`firstName\`, \`lastName\`, \`description\` and \`image\`.
